# TinyRobotFriend
Tiny robot friend made with a Seeed Studio rp2040, D-Pad, OLED screen, and more

## Current work:
- Start adding in games to play which can be selected from the menu
    - (The c/c++ extension in vscode is choosing to crash when I try making classes for the games, isn't that great)
- Create a class for the piezo to make it easy to play sounds from whatever sub-process im in (i.e. menu, game, face, etc)
